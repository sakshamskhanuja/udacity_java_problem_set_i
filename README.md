## Problem Set

### Question 1

Define an integer variable called ```bankBalance```. Initialize it to a value of 500. Then add 250 to it. Then subtract 100 from it. Finally, print the resulting value.

### Question 2

Write Java code to define an integer variable called ```day```, and a String variable called ```month```. Give ```month``` and ```day``` appropriate values for your birthday.

### Question 3

Write Java code to create a String variable called ```firstName```, define it to be your first name as a String. Then define a variable called ```lastName``` and define it to be your last name as a String. Then define a variable called ```fullName``` and set it to be your first name followed by a space followed by your last name. Use the existing variables for your first and last name and String concatenation to define ```fullName```.<br>
Finally, write code to print this text:

```         
Hello, my name is [full name].
There are [number] letters in my name.
```

Use String concatenation to create the first String to print using the ```fullName``` variable, and use the ```.length()``` command on ```firstName``` and ```lastName``` to calculate the number of letters.

Note: you can concatenate an integer and a String and the integer will be converted to a String.

### Question 4

Write Java code to define a double variable called ```fahrenheit``` and set it to an initial value between 0 and 100. Then, create a double variable called ```celsius```, and calculate its value based on the value of fahrenheit. (To convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius, subtract 32, then multiply by 5, then divide by 9.) Finally, print the final value of ```celsius```.
